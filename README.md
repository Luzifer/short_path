# Luzifer / short\_path

`short_path` is a very small utility to shorten the current path into a less readable but more useful version to be included in shell prompts. Especially Go developers know paths like `/home/luzifer/workspaces/private/go/src/github.com/Luzifer/short_path` which already takes up most of the space on the prompt. This tool shortens the path to `~/w/p/g/s/g/Luzifer/short_path` which is much shorter and you should be able to know from that what the elements are.
